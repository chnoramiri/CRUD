# CRUD Project

This project is to provide a simple CRUD application that demonstrates the use of React, TypeScript, Sass, and JSON-Server and plus manage the whole tasks by AzureDevops. The application allows users to manage data records using a web interface.


## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- Sass: A CSS preprocessor that adds features and functionality to CSS
- JSON-Server: A fake REST API for prototyping and mocking


## Features

- Create a new data record
- Read an existing data record
- Update an existing data record
- Delete an existing data record

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

 1. Clone the repository to your local machine
 2. Install dependencies using npm install
 3. Start the JSON-Server using npm run json-server
 4. Start the React app using npm start
 5. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in using TypeScript and Sass to improve the efficiency and maintainability of my code. I also utilized Azure DevOps for task management, which helped me stay organized and focused throughout the project.

With TypeScript, I was able to add static typing to my React components, making them more robust and easier to maintain. Sass provided me with advanced features like variables, which improved my code's efficiency and made it more organized. While I faced a challenge trying to pass a value from TypeScript to Sass, I was able to find a solution using CSS custom properties.

In summary, TypeScript and Sass are essential tools for web development that improve code quality and efficiency. By utilizing task management tools like Azure DevOps, developers can stay organized and focused on their project goals. I am excited to continue using these tools in future projects to build even better applications.
